# 1. In this exercise we will make a "Patient" class
#
# The Patient class should store the state of
# a patient in our hospital system.
#
#
# 1.1)
# Create a class called "Patient".
# The constructor should have two parameters
# (in addition to self, of course):
#
# 1. name (str)
# 2. symptoms (list of str)
#
# the parameters should be stored as attributes
# called "name" and "symptoms" respectively
class Patient:

    def __init__(self, name: str, symptoms: list):
        self.name = name
        self.symptoms = symptoms

#
# 1.2)
# Create a method called "add_test"
# which takes two paramters:
# 1. the name of the test (str)
# 2. the results of the test (bool)
#
# This information should be stored somehow.
class Patient:

#
# 1.3)
# Create a method called has_covid()
# which takes no parameters.
#
# "has_covid" returns a float, between 0.0
# and 1.0, which represents the probability
# of the patient to have Covid-19
#
# The probability should work as follows:
#
# 1. If the user has had the test "covid"
#    then it should return .99 if the test
#    is True and 0.01 if the test is False
# 2. Otherwise, probability starts at 0.05
#    and ncreases by 0.1 for each of the
#    following symptoms:
#    ['fever', 'cough', 'anosmia']

# 2. In this exercise you will make an English Deck class made of Card classes
# 
# the Card class should represent each of the cards
#
# the Deck class should represent the collection of cards and actions on them

# 2.1) Create a Card class called "Card".
# The constructor (__init__ ) should have two parameters the "suit" and the "value" and the suit of the card.
# The class should store both as attributes.

# The constructor will create an English Deck (suits: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades and values: A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K). It will create a list of cards that contain each of the existing cards in an English Deck.
# Create a method called "shuffle" that shuffles the cards randomly. 
# Create a method called "draw" that will draw a single card and print the suit and value. When a card is drawn, the card should be removed from the deck.

# for different figures to compute their perimeter and surface. 

# 3.1Create an abstract class (interface) called "PlaneFigure" with two abstract methods:
# compute_perimeter() that will implement the formula to compute the perimiter of the plane figure.
# compute_surface() that will implement the formula to compute the surface of the plane figure.
